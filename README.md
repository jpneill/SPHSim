SPHSim
======
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics is a particle based method for simulating the motion of fluids. The fluids are divided into discrete particles that each bear the physical properties of the fluid at the point where they exist.

This application applies the theory of SPH to the motion of an elastic material undergoing compression. The elasticity of the material is simulated by the addition of springs between each of the particles.

Installation
============
Clone the repository in Windows.
Requires .net 3.5 and XNA.

Use
===
Fill in all the fields on the left side. It is advised to keep the simulation time below 30 seconds.
Once the simulation is calculate use the Play/Pause button to play the simulation.
When the simulation is paused the physical properties of each particle can be output to a .csv file.
